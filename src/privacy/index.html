<h1 id="ourdataprivacypolicy">Our Data &amp; Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>To make sure Hedge works as promised we need to collect data. It ensures and improves quality. Without data we would be forced to conduct pricey and less effective research, which would result in a much higher price for you, the user.</p>

<p>Still, to us this feels as an undesirable situation. It's creepy. It's too easy nowadays to slip into the Land Of Gimme-All-Yer-Data, and make money off <em>your</em> data. So hereby we offer you a complete insight into what we think is the bare minimum of data needed to run Hedge.</p>

<p>We do not share raw data with anyone, ever. Period. We consider the data yours, and you give us a right to use that data by using Hedge.</p>

<p>Consider this document as a guidance. It does not have any legal stature. For that we refer you to our EULA.</p>

<h3 id="notracktrace">No Track &amp; Trace</h3>

<p>All data stored by us internally has been anonymized and is not retraceable to you or anyone else. Your installation of Hedge does have a unique id, which we don’t have access to. This ensures true anonymity.</p>

<h3 id="opt-out">Opt-out</h3>

<p>If you want your data removed from our records you can put in a request through privacy@hedgeformac.com. Because all data is anonymized we don't know which records are yours. We will need more information from you to be able to find the records and delete them.</p>

<h3 id="website">Website</h3>

<p>Our website uses Google Analytics to gather data about its visitors. To do this, a cookie is set. This data is not used to target one certain individual, only for trend insights. All anonymization options Google offers have been turned on, in compliance with Dutch privacy laws.</p>

<h3 id="payments">Payments</h3>

<p>We do not store payment information ourselves, but let FastSpring handle this process. Their security and due diligence is tailored to the level needed when dealing with money. FastSpring provides us with the following information about you:</p>

<ul>
<li>The subscription timestamp</li>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>Your address</li>
<li>Your IP address</li>
<li>Your email address</li>
<li>Payment method</li>
<li>Your phone number if you provided it</li>
<li>Amount of VAT payed, if any</li>
</ul>

<p>We don't have access to credit card information or anything like that.</p>

<h3 id="installationupdates">Installation &amp; Updates</h3>

<p>To make the installation and update process work, we need to collect information about your computer. We use DevMate to manage this process. We cannot retrieve raw data from DevMate, only summaries. To our knowledge, DevMate collects the following to make sure you can install and update Hedge:</p>

<ul>
<li>Type of hardware (&quot;MacbookPro10,1&quot;) including GPU, CPU and RAM</li>
<li>OS Version (&quot;OS X 10.10.5&quot;)</li>
<li>App Version (&quot;19&quot;)</li>
<li>OS Language (&quot;En&quot;)</li>
<li>Amount Of App Launches (&quot;a total of x users opened the app y times&quot;)</li>
<li>Usage Frequency (&quot;a total of x users opened the app every y days&quot;)</li>
</ul>

<p>DevMate also handles Crash Reports and issues reported by you manually. When doing so you can review the data sent along, and decide not to do so. Please do though, we can't really help you without that information. </p>

<p>DevMate also handles the licensing, in direct collaboration with FastSpring. We don't have access to the data needed to make this work.</p>

<p>You can opt-out from DevMate's data gathering from the Preferences panel.</p>

<h3 id="newsletterssurveys">Newsletters &amp; Surveys</h3>

<p>We regularly send out emails to our users and others who have subscribed. We use MailChimp to do so. MailChimp collects your email address, name, sign-up date and IP address. All information you put in a form is stored in MailChimp too. We add some extra data to MailChimp to make sure we don't send you too many emails.</p>

<p>When you open an email or click a link in an email, MailChimp records this. We can manually determine which user has done so, but we don't. We only collect summarized campaign statistics from MailChimp. </p>

<p>Polls are the one exception: if we do a poll in a newsletter to get specific feedback, we know who voted. This way we make sure everyone that didn’t isn’t bugged by follow-up emails on the subject.</p>

<p>If you sign up for our mailing list we reserve the right to contact you in person. Not to sell anything to you, but probably because you're really cool and we'd like to do a special project or showcase with you.</p>

<h3 id="appusage">App Usage</h3>

<p>To learn how our app is used we collect statistics. The data is collected by Parse, and we use this data for in-house analysis. We collect the following data points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Installation ID</li>
<li>OS X Version</li>
<li>Hedge Version &amp; Build</li>
<li>trial: free or licensed version</li>
<li>Event Name (appOpen, diskIdle, diskBusy, fileCopyCompleted, nameChanged) with timestamps</li>
<li>Disks: size, free space, mountedAt, unmountedAt</li>
<li>Names: diskTitle, new and old when diskName is changed. All hashed!</li>
<li>Transfers: duration, startedAt, verified or not, protocol, bytesCopied, ETA</li>
<li>State (transfer failed, successful, or cancelled by user)</li>
<li>Types: currentDiskType, previousDiskType (Source, Destination, Ignored, Unknown)</li>
<li>folderFormat (format of the folder Hedge creates for every import)</li>
<li>hasScript: if you used a script with an Event.</li>
</ul>

<p>This data is not retraceable to single person. The installation ID is not accessible from within the app without action from both you and us.</p>

<h3 id="ch-ch-changes">Ch-Ch-Changes</h3>

<p>Our development process is iterative: each sprint we decide on new features and the data needed to build and validate it. When done we will remove the data point, unless it's part of an ongoing process (like a quality measurement). If a data point is added to the app, it will be added to this document.</p>

<h3 id="duediligence">Due Diligence</h3>

<p>Login credentials to the third parties mentioned above are not shared outside our executive layer of employees. Data collected from those third parties for internal use is collected through API's or by executives.</p>

<h3 id="policiesneedpolicing">Policies need policing</h3>

<p>If you think we use your or anyone's data in a wrongful way, or should be more stringent in how we use it, please let us know. We promise to be responsive, cooperate and stay open to suggestions.</p>
